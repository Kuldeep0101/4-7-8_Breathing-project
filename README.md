# 4-7-8_Breathing-project
This is a minimal 4-7-8 breathing web app built in a single HTML file. It guides you through inhale-hold-exhale cycles using visual cues, changing colors, countdown timers, and soothing beeps. It also tracks your total reps and session duration, with Start, Pause, and End controls for full session management.
